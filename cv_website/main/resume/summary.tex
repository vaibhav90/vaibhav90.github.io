As a seasoned software engineer with a decade of experience, I excel in harmonizing technical strategies with business objectives. 
I currently spearhead the technical development of Data Engineering and AI projects at Debiopharm, a leading Swiss pharmaceutical firm. 
My expertise spans the complete technical spectrum - from selecting infrastructure and designing architecture, to constructing ETL pipelines and productionizing language model-based applications. 
Equipped with a solid academic foundation, inclusive of a Ph.D. in Computer Science, and a robust industry background, I offer distinctive insights to tackle complex technical challenges.

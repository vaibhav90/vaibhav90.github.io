1. 4 ways to cyberproof your business during mergers and acquisitions

a. The right team
b. Holistically evaluate the cybersecurity capabilities of the target
c. Develop and follow a clear strategy to securely integrate
d. continue to develop cybersecurity capabilities

2. On the edge of a new cyber space age. This is how we make it a success
First, we must build a general culture of resilience, rather than protecting against individual cyberthreats.

3. 8 vital questions we need to address about international cybersecurity

Firstly, a nation’s offensive (including military) cyber capabilities are largely undeclared
Secondly, some states outsource their cyber operations to non-state actors (or proxies).
Thirdly, the hardware and software of a state’s cyber capabilities are shared between its government, its private sector, and its citizens.

9. Overcoming the paralysis of trust management across a fractured IT landscape

Security is the governance of the right, or lack thereof, to access something.
Digitally, this usually involves encryption and policy management.

Privacy, like the higher-order topic of trust, is a very personal topic. I believe it can be boiled down to the appropriate use of information.
What constitutes appropriate is not static and is subject to change at any moment.

Accountability is more straightforward; people want things to behave consistently and to be provable.
As global enterprises have evolved, they must also now be able to prove what did not happen.

Integrity appears straightforward, yet increases in complexity.
When enterprises rely on thousands of separate IT systems, from storage to processing to networking to analytics,
the integrity of the data supply chain becomes daunting.

10. International law cannot keep up with cyber-criminals

a. in the case of cyber attacks, states don’t generally operate through formal state bodies.
b. Instead, they tend to use non-state actors who are less visible, more removed and offer plausible deniability.
c. The factual problem is that it is often extremely difficult to accurately identify the origin of a cyber attack.
d. The lack of boundaries and anonymity that are characteristic of cyberspace
e. the existing international law framework provides little effective protection or recourse
